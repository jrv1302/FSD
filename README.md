## 📌 Project Overview

FinComplaints AI is a complaint management system tailored for the financial domain. Users can register, log in, and submit detailed financial complaints. The system uses a trained **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** pipeline to instantly classify each complaint into one of five financial categories:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| 🏦 Loans | Home, auto, student & personal loan disputes |
| 📊 Credit Reporting | Credit score errors & bureau disputes |
| 🏢 Bank Services | Account issues, fees & banking problems |
| 📞 Debt Collection | Harassment & unfair collection practices |
| 💳 Credit Card Services | Card billing, rewards & dispute issues |

An **Admin Dashboard** provides analytics, complaint management, and status tracking with interactive charts.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using **SHA-256** before storage
- Admin access is protected by role-based session checks
- All routes use `@login_required` or `@admin_required` decorators
- For production, replace `app.secret_key` with a secure environment variable
